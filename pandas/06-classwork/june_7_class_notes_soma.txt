#any file with a . at the front in github is "hidden"
a .DS_Store file is storing data about the director

adding files to git:

gid add [filename]
gid add . is saying take all of the files in the current director and keep track of them

filename for git ignore file is .gitignore
you make a list of everything you don't want added to repository:

for example
make a sublime text file called .gitignore
list all the files you DONT WANT in the repository

e.g.
.DS_Store
tmp
*.bac

should be what's written in the sublime text file, saved as .gitignore

if you then do git add .
while in the proper directory
it'll ignore everything you asked it to

. means current director
