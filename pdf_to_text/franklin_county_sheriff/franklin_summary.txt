Kate Cough
Franklin County Sheriff's Office Summary

The data comes from this page: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/franklin-county-10426/gun-policies-incidents-franklin-county-fl-33794/#files

in response to a request filed by Vanessa Nason

The data is information from the Franklin County Sheriff's office in Eastpoint, Florida, on incidents involving firearms.

I converted the PDF, which did not have readable text, to a png file-first to a series of png files, then to one file-that I then ran tesseract on and was able to upload into a notebook.
