We want to match numbers

NOTES:
Hold down command option F to search
Click .* in the lower left hand corner

YYYY-MM-DD

design a fill-in-the-blanks model of the entire line.

The ______ day of the _______ month of the year __________

the day is \d+ or [0-9]
the month is \d+ or [0-9]
the year is \d+ or [0-9]

the \d+rd day of the \d+th month in the year \d+
(but this only matches the first line-note the rd)

for the second line you need to have something that matches rd or th:
\d+[rn]d day of the \d(th|rd) month in the year 

(\d+).*(\d+).*(\d+) 

This is the best option: give me numbers (\d+) and then give me literally anything (.*)

now what if we want to be able to move it around? the year in the front, etc.

We have to capture the pieces we're interested in and rearrange them.

() is capture

\3-\2-\1

hit replace

(\d+).*(\d+).*(\d+) 

We want: 1986-4-3 but it's only giving us the last number, because it thinks everything else is random.

(\d+).*(\d+).*(\d\d\d\d?) 
this is saying give me at least three, then a ? means maybe another digit if there is one
(\d+).*(\d+).*(\d{3,4}) 

(\d+).*(\d+)[a-z]*(\d+) 

to add zeros to make it 1986-04-09:

1986-4-9

-(\d)$ >>> is saying if there's a digit after the dash, replace it with 0 , $ is give me whatever you capture
-0\1-

The 3rd day of the 4th month in the year 1986
The 2nd day of the 8th month in the year 2001
The 22nd day of the 3rd month in the year 2003
The 9th day of the 9th month in the year 800


IF YOU WANT TO MATCH A SPECIAL CHARACTER
you need to escape it first with a \ like \(.*) will match the paranthesis

put " " around your replace with captures "\1,"

Notes on Uncleaned Categories::

Let's clean it up and put it into a CSV. Add a comma after the number.


(\d\d\d\d)
