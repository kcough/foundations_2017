//the code below we took from leaflet documentation -> other layers -> geojson -> usage. we edited it to say 'states' instead of data
// because that's our variable
// the stuff below is a dictionary with ONE KEY: style. it says every time you look at one of these polygons look at the style color
//we changed the color to black. note we only changed it below, not in each one. 
//we changed bindPopUp below to tool tip because we want to mouse over. 
//look at the data. what other properties do we have? we have something called 'name' change layer.feature.properties.description to layer.feature.properties.name
//next, we created a variable geolayer and added it to the map. then we added fitBounds so it fits our map and centers on it.
//then we went to http://geojson.io/#map=3/51.56/-100.37 and drew some shapes. we clicked on table and added a gdp column



// map.fitBounds(geoLayer.getBounds())
